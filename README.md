# DesignPattern

This repository contains Java code for different design patterns.

## How to Execute

In Windows, go to the root directory of the project and execute the `compile.bat` script. This script requires an argument, which is the main class for the specific design pattern you want to run.

### Singleton Design Pattern
To execute the Singleton Design Pattern, use the following command:
```bat
compile.bat MainSingle
```


### Factory Design Pattern
To execute the Factory Design Pattern, use the following command:
```bat
compile.bat MainFabrique 1
```
You can replace `1` with any argument of your choice.

### Prototype Design Pattern
To execute the Prototype Design Pattern, use the following command:
```bat
compile.bat MainPrototype 
```

Make sure you have Java installed on your system, and the necessary class files are available for the design patterns you want to run.

Feel free to update this README with more information or explanations for each design pattern and how they work.
